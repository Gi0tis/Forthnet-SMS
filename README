This is a simple script using Python's "Mechanize" library.
It is written in order to avoid the use of Forthnet's WebSMS Service website, when sending text-messages.
Its use is simple. Just follow the instructions and write the phone number and the text-message you would like to send.

Dependencies:
Mechanize Library (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mechanize)

To install mechanize: "pip install mechanize"
You also have to change the script's "login_email" and "password" variables properly.
